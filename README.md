# RiRi on Repeat 
## API Project one
## Technologies: 

```bash
Html, JS, CSS, JQuery, Google Fonts
```
## API: [Deezer Music API](https://rapidapi.com/deezerdevs/api/deezer-1)

## Features: 

This app will provide following paramters for the user input, which is a Rihanna song: you type in:
song name, explicit lyrics (yes/no), album title, tracklist, album cover, and 30s preview of song searched. 

On the interactive navigation bar, links are provided to websites with information on community outreach, cosmetics, apparrel, music videos, and social handles.

## Stretch Goals/Future Goals: 

* Preset audio player volume to halfway, and customize the player/make turntables
* Control for ghost keys in the API so searched songs present in the API are not showing up in the browers as unkown songs
* More complex styling
* On click add listener that puts a puff of smoke over page and clears out to info
* Cleaner/more efficient code HTML, CSS, JS and JQuery
