## Stretch Goals/Future Goals:
* Clear tracks playlist when a search was succesful and the next search is an unkown song
* Preset audio player volume to halfway, and customize the player/make turntables
* Control for ghost keys in the API so searched songs present in the API are not showing up in the browers as unkown songs
* More complex styling
* On click add listener that puts a puff of smoke over page and clears out to info
* Cleaner/more efficient code HTML, CSS, JS and JQuery
